### Hiya! 👋 Welcome to my github

I'm Alex, a computer science enthusiast from Ontario, Canada 🇨🇦. Here's a little bit about me:

 - 🎉 I recently graduated from the University of Waterloo with a BMath (CS) and a minor in combinatorics and optimization
 - 💻 I enjoy coding stuff in my free time -- usually scripting stuff or games that I enjoyed growing up
 - 🍭 I'm also a sucker for complexity theory, algorithms, and programming languages
 - 🏓 In my free time, you'll catch me playing ping pong

Get in touch if you want to collaborate, or just want to say hi! I'm always excited to work on new projects 😄
